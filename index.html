      <p>Hi, I'm Jesse Nnadi, a passionate software development student from Lagos, Nigeria. 👋
I'm currently studying at BYU-Idaho and super excited to dive deep into software development! 💻 My dream is to build innovative software that brings people closer together and makes the world more connected. 🌍
When I'm not coding, you'll catch me on the pitch playing football ⚽ or getting immersed in epic video game adventures 🎮. Always up for a good match or a new level!</p>

      <p>Imo State is one of the most densely populated states in Nigeria and a vibrant heartland of Igbo culture in the South-East geopolitical zone. Located in the southeastern region, bordered by Anambra to the north, Rivers to the west and south, and Abia to the east, it serves as a key agricultural and educational hub, with significant contributions from palm oil production, crude oil extraction, and natural gas. Known for its lush landscapes, major rivers like the Imo and Otamiri, and the scenic Oguta Lake, Imo State boasts lively markets, rich traditions, festivals, and a blend of rural charm and urban energy in its capital, Owerri. Despite challenges such as erosion and rapid population growth, the state thrives as a center of innovation, literacy, higher education, and opportunity in southeastern Nigeria.</p>
